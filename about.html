        <h2> Welcome</h2>
        <h3> I'm Jack Gallagher</h3>
        <p>
           I'm an Information Science and Computer Engineering student enrolled at State University of New York at Oswego with expected graduation in Spring of 2026.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio. If you have questions, comments, or inquires, feel free to contact me using <a href="contact.html">this form</a> or send an email: <a href="mailto:jackgallagher917@gmail.com">Mail</a>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            As a child I had a fascination for the inter workings of media and technology. At first my interest was more towards film and media being a part of a school film in 5th grade. But I moved more towards technology after receiving a early 2008 macbook and getting into emulation. During middle school I learned about Linux and used my first distro, Zorin.
        </p>

        <p> During High School, thanks in part to my sister, I shifted more towards Engineering after Join the ACE after school program (Architecture, Construction, Engineering) gravitating towards Electrical Engineering field. I worked on different projects such as renovation project for the James Beard Foundation and pier 92.
            Alongside this, I started learning how to code, mainly with python with the huge library support. The project that I mainly worked on were simple apps or fixes to existing open source projects.
        In the beginning of Covid Pandemic, myself and fellow students <a href="">Yoav Tirosh</a> & <a href=""> Isaac Perkis</a> started a company/group ApexBLD. Our goal was building affordable desktops and backlog laptop systems to other student struggling to operate remotely. People who utilized our services during this time expressed an improvement productivity and grades compared to when using school provided systems. </p>

        <p> In 2022, I got execpted into SUNY Oswego, originally for Electrical and Computer Engineering, but after taking a few Electrical Engineering and Information Science, I relived that I gravitated more toward coding so at the end of my Freshman year I transitioned to Information Science and Computer Engineering.
            My sophomore year was pivotal in realising my interests towards conducting research after an independent study with Professor Adrian Ieta focusing on ionic winds. His research allowed him to obtain a patient for his work which I was featured within his research (<a href=" https://www.oswego.edu/news/story/professor-earns-patent-ionic-propulsion-technology-breakthrough"> article</a>).
            My current research area is in the field of Cognitive Architecture - creating human-like autonomous behavioral models and training to forge for resource based objectives. Fellow Student and research assistant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-clough-98229b2b1/">James Clough</a> pitched in addition to designing the models, have the systems within drones allowing for both autonomy and resource identification   </p>

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests </h2>
        <ul>
           <p>
               Beyond hardware and software, I have hobbies that I enjoy spending my time doing. I have always been avid about the outdoors, with hiking and camping being the main focus ironic being from a city. Being a part of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) helped shaped my growth in a positive way allowing to gain skills while also being outdoors. Majority of my memories were spend camping at various scouting reserves around New York and New Jersey respectively, with some favorite memories involving winter actives including our annual Christmas Tree fundraising events and winter camping.
